                     river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and
                     great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside
                     Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and
                     historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.
                
                     Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days
                
                     Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich
                     history that the canyon tells.
